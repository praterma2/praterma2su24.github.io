        ROBOTICS AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS DEGREE OBJECTIVES<br><br>
1. Design and complete robotic and embedded systems solutions that address real-world situations and challenges.<br><br>
Artifact 1. <p>A paragraph describing what the artifact does. 
    Keep in mind, a paragraph must have four sentences. This is sentence three. 
    I really hope this works</p>
    Proof of it working<br>
